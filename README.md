# Some Features About My Project

- Welcome to our project, “Part Time”. This is a marketplace where buyers and sellers can interact seamlessly. Our homepage is designed with user-friendly navigation in mind, featuring a menu that allows users to easily navigate through the website.

We’ve also included a banner with a slider that provides information about our company. Below the banner, you’ll find a section with various job postings, designed with a tab-based version for easy navigation. Users can simply click on a tab to find the job posts they’re interested in.

Additionally, we have a client testimonial section where you can read about the experiences of our satisfied customers. We also feature a section that highlights the unique features of our service.

And finally, at the bottom of the page, you’ll find our footer with additional information and links. We hope you enjoy using our platform!

- In the menu bar, you’ll find an option named “Add Job”. Upon clicking this, users will be directed to a form where they can fill out the necessary details to post a job. Please note that users must be logged in to access this page.

The “Add Job” form includes fields for the job title, email, deadline, category, minimum price, maximum price, photo URL, and a description. Once all the necessary information is filled out, users can click the “Add Job” button to successfully post their job. We’ve designed this process to be as straightforward and user-friendly as possible.

- In the menu bar, there’s a convenient feature called “My Posted Jobs”. This is where users can view all the jobs they have posted. Not only can they review their job posts, but they also have the ability to update the job data if needed. If they decide a job post is no longer relevant, they have the option to delete it. This feature provides users with full control over their job postings, ensuring they can manage their listings effectively and efficiently.
- From the menu bar, users can access the “My Bids” section. This is where they can view all their bid data and check the status of each bid. Initially, the status of a bid is set to “Pending”. Once the job owner accepts the bid, the status updates to “In Progress”. If the job owner rejects the bid, the status will show as “Cancelled”.

Users can mark “In Progress” bids as “Complete” once they finish the job. This page provides a comprehensive overview of all bid activities, allowing users to manage their bids effectively.

- In the “Bid Request” page, job owners can find a table that displays all the bids placed on their job posts. This is where they can review all the bid data, including the job title, bidder’s email, project deadline, and the bid price.

Each bid is accompanied by an “Accept” and “Reject” button, giving job owners the ability to manage the bids on their posts. If a bid is accepted, the bidder is notified and can start working on the project. If a bid is rejected, the bidder is also notified. This page provides job owners with full control over the bidding process, ensuring they can select the most suitable candidate for their job.
